			<h3>The negative effects of genetic engineering on society</h3>
			<p>It may hamper the diversity of cultures. This would occur because humans in their nature, would use genetic engineering to keep the strongest traits and get rid of the bad ones, which would in turn make our society less diverse and, in all honesty, more boring.</p>

			<h3>The detrimental effects of genetic engineering on health</h3>
			<p>While genetic engineering is a great thing, it may lower overall nutritional value in natural foodstuffs. Modifying genes also can create new, stronger breeds of pathogens; When we modify the genes of a plant to make it more resistant to some things, there is a large chance that the resistance genes can be passed onto pathogens.</p>

			<h3>The ethic detractors</h3>
			<p>Even though genetically engineering someone to be stronger may be useful or nice to them, genetic engineering could be used for negative things, such as non-voluntary experiments, which can and most likely will cause mental issues. Also, if something goes wrong, you risk mentally hampering the person who was experimented on; which in turn will introduce a higher chance of genetic defect into a family who may have already been plagued with genetic defects, which is hardly ethical at all!</p>
