			<h3>Before you understand what genetic engineering is...</h3>
			<p>You must understand what genes are. Genes are long strands, or segments, of DNA (Deoxyribonecleic Acid) that identify certain traits in an organism, for instance blue eyes or brown hair.</p>
			<h3>What is DNA?</h3>
			<p>You may be thinking, "Well I know what genes are, to some degree, but what's this DNA that you were talking about?" Allow me to explain. DNA is a collection of nitrogen bases, which in turn are collections of molecules of Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine, Adenine, and Uracil.
			   What I just named, the molecules, are <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/element">elements</a>, and you probably know what an element is.</p>
			<h3>Onto the real question...</h3>
			<p>Now, you may be thinking, "Well, this is all fine and dandy, but what is genetic engineering?!" Genetic engineering is the manipulation of aforementioned genes, whether by transplanting them cross-species, or by changing the nucleotide bases, to change what the gene is "read" as when it is copied by the messenger <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/RNA?s=t">RNA</a>, brought to the ribosome to be translated into proteins by the transfer <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/RNA?s=t">RNA</a>.</p>

			<div class="Facts">
			<h3>Random facts that don't fit anywhere else!</h3>
			<ol>
			<li>Genetic manipulation happens naturally, to a certain degree.</li>
			<li>DNA is actually a collection of simple sugars and phosphate groupings.</li>
			<li>The gene was chemically explained, in 1953, by Francis Criek and Jamie Swatson.</li>
			<li>Genetic engineering became possible in 1954, shortly after the gene was "discovered".</li>
